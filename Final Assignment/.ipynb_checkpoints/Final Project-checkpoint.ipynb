    "<p>Fanfiction (works written by fans of a book, television or online streaming program, movie, comic, etc.) often diverges significantly from the canon work (i.e. the original work on which fanfiction stories are based) and could be seen as what fans would prefer to have happened. These works may also show how people feel about characters from the canon by portraying the characters differently. For example, the are many fanfictions that show portray the <i>Harry Potter</i> characters Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy fondly, despite Snape being an antihero and Draco Malfoy largely an antagonist in J.K. Rowling's original work.</p>\n",
    "<p>Previous scholarship has looked at how fan works differ from cannon works, including gender represenation and character portrayal (Bamman & Milli, 2015; Strauch, 2016); the stylistics of fanfiction (Girouard & Rubin, 2013); and fanfiction as transforamtive work (Van Steenhuyse, 2011). These works have also included work based only on the author supplied metadata on themes and character pairings. It has also come to this author's attention that there is currently a McGill undergraduate student working on quantifying queer dynamics in fanfiction using Digital Humanites methods and a McGill PhD student lookign at fanfiction in the context of copyright.</p>\n",
    "<p>This project seeks to assess fan sentiment towards the characters of Amazon Prime's 2017 to present <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i>, using text mining with Python 3 and Voyant Tools to look at parts of speech and collocates. The works examined were all posted the fanfiction website Archive of Our Own (AO3), marked as complete by their authors, written in English, had a word count of at least one word (AO3 users can upload artworks or links to vieos as well), and are not crossovers (works containg characters or settings from multiple fictional worlds). This resulted in a small corpus (47 works), which likely leads to imprecise or inaccurate results. An ideal iteration of this project would use: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>a significantly larger corpus of works</li> \n",
    "<li>a fandom with more clearly defined protangonists, antagonists, and antiheroes</li>\n",
    "<li>works from multiple sites hosting fanfiction\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>AO3</li>\n",
    "<li>fanfiction.net</li>\n",
    "<li>LiveJournal</li>\n",
    "<li>fandom specific sites</li>\n",
    "</ul></li></ul>\n",
    "However, due to time and technological constraints, the corpus of 47 works was analyzed for this project. The coding and some explaination of it used for scraping and text analysis can be found in <a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nlgauvreau/LLCU612/blob/master/Final%20Assignment/Appendix%201%E2%80%93Scraping%20Work.ipynb\">Appendix 1</a> and <a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nlgauvreau/LLCU612/blob/master/Final%20Assignment/Appendix%202%E2%80%93Text%20Analysis%20Work.ipynb\">Appendix 2</a>, respectively.</p>"

Lenny and Susie see similar linkages: \"lenny\" to lenny, midge, bruce (Lenny's surname), it's, and just and \"susie\" to susie, midge, miriam, hand, and like.</p>"

    "<p>While Python 3 with various libraries and Voyant Tools can be used to aid in looking at fan sentiment toward characters through the medium of fanfiction, it is a difficult task. It is possibe that this could be made easier with the application of sentiment analysis. Fanfiction authors for <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i> fandom seem to focus on the shows clear protagonists, rather than anti-heroes or antagonists as is seen in other fandoms and do not often describe characters. Some character actions are described with adverbs, but these do not always corrolae with the character also being seen as such. Additionally, in the use of adjectives such as \"pretty\", fan writers are largely keeping with the on screen depiction of characters, rather than putting forth their own sentiments.</p>\n",
    "<p>An analysis as attempted in this project could be aided by some combination of using a larger corpus, working from a fandom based on a literary work, and  working on a fandom with a larger number of defined antagonists and antiheroes or protangonists who arae not depicted in an largely rosey manner. Alternatively, methods similar to this attempted analysis could be used towards assessing desired plotlines, outcomes, or for diverse representation.</p>"
