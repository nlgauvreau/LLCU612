It was my suitcase

I don't know how you feel about community property
-- you know: "his, mine, ours" --

now, I agree, some things in a marriage are definitely "ours"
the kids, the car, that song they played on our first date
those things are "ours"
but there's still "his" job, "his" toothbrush, "his" parents
-- don't even get me started on his parents --
but there are things that are mine. "My" toothbrush
"my" clothes, "my" mother
-- and we both agree, she is definitely not his --
and I thought that was my suitcase. But I guess I was wrong

It was powder blue. Not sky blue, not sea blue, definitely not navy
-- I'd never be caught dead with a navy blue suitcase, too serious --
but perfect serene powder blue
my mother bought it for me before my trip to Paris
-- not that I actually went to Paris, she changed her mind at the last minute --
but that's where I was supposed to go with it
with the dresses we bought to go to Paris
my dresses, that my mother bought to go in my suitcase

so I was surprised -- nay, I was shocked --
when my husband packed my suitcase
his clothes, in my suitcase
when he left me. Us, I suppose, because he left
me and the kids, we're an "us" now, I guess
he also left the marriage, so that's another "us" he left
just took my suitcase with his clothes and left

when my husband left me, he took my suitcase
his, mine, ours, all packed up
in powder blue leather
that never went to Paris
and never, really
belonged to me
