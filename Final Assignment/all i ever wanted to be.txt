“You know, if they would’ve given me that elevator operator job at B. Altman, I would’ve been the one wearing those things,” Midge says, waving her hands at the general vicinity of Susie’s waist.

Susie takes a puff off her cigarette and scuffles at the scrambled eggs on her stove with a dented spatula. “What, pants? I sure fucking hope so. You think you need a ball gown to push buttons?”

“Not the pants,” Midge says, though she thinks a velvet skirt suit would be quite the look for the store’s first lady operator. “The suspenders. All the best operators wear them.”

“Did you take a poll? Subscribe to the newsletter?” Susie brings a plate of too-dry eggs and an ashtray over to the Murphy bed where Midge is still tangled up in the blankets. “Attend the bi-weekly meeting of New York’s finest operators and the ones who lifted before them?”

“I think they’re sexy,” Midge says. She winds her hand through one of the suspenders that hang around Susie’s hips and tugs her down onto the bed. “Maybe I wouldn’t be able to wear them in the elevator. The seduction would be overwhelming. I’d have so many admirers I’d become distracted and send people plummeting to their deaths.” She grins and Susie melts, but just a little. “Can you imagine?”

“So modest,” Susie grumbles, but leans down for a kiss. “Mrs. Maisel, everyone. The Manhattan Elevator Murderess.”

“Introduce me like that tonight,” Midge says, and eagerly returns the kiss.
