 There must be thousands of people in this city who are dying to welcome you into their small bolted rooms, to sit you down and tell you what has happened to their lives. And the night smells like snow. Walking home, for a moment you almost believe you could start again. And an intense love rushes to your heart, and hope. It’s unendurable, unendurable. - Franz Wright, “East Boston, 1996″ Ellie wakes early, unused to the brightness the morning light produces in her newly painted bedroom. And, if she's being honest, completely fucking thrown by the hefty weight of Alec's arm around her waist.  She takes a few deep breaths, and then delicately removes his arm from its resting place, adjusting herself so that she can catalog his sleeping form. She allows herself a few moments to trace the scar on his chest, run her fingers through the soft hair there. Sex looks good on him, she thinks, wryly.  “Time is it?” he mumbles, bleary-eyed and irritatingly charming at this early hour. She must've woken him up.  “Mmm. About half eight.” She directs her gaze back to her fingers tracing his scar, embarrassed suddenly at being caught watching him sleep.   Alec stills the motion of her hand on his chest, bringing it up to his mouth to press soft kisses to her fingertips. Ellie’s breath hitches at the gesture, and she buries her face in her pillow, a sad attempt at hiding her watery smile. She wonder briefly if she’ll cry. She has never been good at this, the morning-after bit. Last night he’d pushed himself inside of her with something like tenderness, and after, when she’d whispered I love you as he tucked errant curls behind her ear, she almost didn’t regret it. But now — in the harsh morning light — she wonders what to do with all of this vulnerability, this leftover tenderness that threatens to spill out of her. Alec tangles their legs together underneath the sheets, and she takes a moment to inventory all that she’s learned about him in the past twelve hours. She has shared a bed with him before, of course. And while she already knew he didn’t snore, she finds she quite likes the warmth of him beside her, is pleasantly surprised by the amount of hair on his chest, the space he takes up in her bed. “What are you thinking about?” His voice cuts through her anxious musings. She lifts her head from her pillow, then, and inches closer to him. It would be a shame to waste all of that body heat. “Mmm, nothing. Just that I need to get up soon. Gotta pick up the boys from Lucy’s.” “I should get going, too. Think Daisy’s heading home from Chloe’s soon.” He makes no motion to move, though, and his hands start their own lazy inventory of her body. “Think you can tolerate me for an extra five minutes?” He murmurs, his voice a soft, rumbling sound close to her ear. She chuckles, her breathing starting to quicken at the way he nibbles on her neck. “Extra five minutes, huh? That doesn’t sound very promising.” He bites the skin between her neck and shoulder in retaliation, soothing it quickly with his tongue before continuing his ministrations. He pauses briefly on his trek downward, letting his tongue dip into her belly button, and says, “I’ll make it worth your while.” Ellie lets out a breathy sigh and lays her head back against the pillow, content to stop thinking for the moment. An extra five minutes doesn't sound so bad.  Later, when she comes downstairs to walk him out, she’s dressed to pick up the boys in a jumper with a high neckline. His kiss goodbye is soft, but firm, and she swears there is smugness about him that wasn’t there the night before. Late into their third month, during one of their many failed movie nights, she asks: “Do we tell people about us?” The boys are safely tucked in upstairs, Fred having finally succumbed to sleep after guilting Alec into reading him three stories. With special voices, of course. Ellie had been so charmed by his animation, and the deep, gruff voice he employed for all of the beasts in Where the Wild Things Are, that she had nixed her original movie-watching plans. It is rare that she gets to observe him in moments like this, where she gets a glimpse at what he might have been like as a young father. It is disconcerting, how much she likes it.  He had been in the middle of collecting his reward for getting Fred to sleep when she had stopped him. Now, he runs his fingers through his hair and straightens his shirt before asking, “Do you want to? Tell people about us, I mean.” She smiles, a little sadly, and briefly mourns the version of herself that would have already told Beth ten times over. Things had changed. “I’d like to tell the kids, at least.” “We can do that." He moves to take her hand, his thumb stroking her knuckles. "Why all of the sudden, though?" Shortly after their first night together they had decided to keep this thing between the two of them, both in agreement that the people of Broadchurch had enough to gossip about without adding further fuel to the fire. They had enjoyed the secrecy of it, though. Had gotten pleasure in searching for stolen moments, sneaking each other upstairs long after their kids had gone to bed, trying to be quiet.  Telling their kids was, essentially, opening their relationship up to scrutiny. And, it was admitting that it was, in fact, a real relationship. A serious relationship. "Mmm, I've decided I like you." At his cheeky grin, she amends: "A little. Still on the fence about your taste in movies." "And your cooking is shit," he says, with a chuckle. He removes his hand from hers, and cups her cheek, his thumb outlining her fine bone structure. "But yeah, I like you too." This time, when he kisses her, she doesn't interrupt.  They plan to tell their children about their relationship all at once, a not-quite family meeting in Ellie’s sitting room. She had fretted about it for weeks, bought books about dating with children, highlighted whole paragraphs. Tom and Daisy had formed a tentative friendship after Daisy’s arrival in Broadchurch. Daisy had taken to Fred instantly, though, and had become his self-appointed child minder when Alec and Ellie were out late on a case. And, as a consequence of their increasingly hectic work schedule, their children spent quite a bit of time together. Though she knew, rationally, that their changing relationship would not drastically alter the day-to-day grind of their two families, she still worried.  Ellie had found that parenting two children alone was mostly about worrying, and preparing for the unexpected every day.  She is furious with herself, then, when the conversation with Tom, Fred, and Daisy veers into the unexpected.  Much to Ellie’s dismay — and Alec’s complete embarrassment — they were not as covert as they had thought. In the middle of her long and nurturing explanation on the changing nature of adult relationships, and the importance of moving on, Tom and Daisy start laughing. “Mum,” Tom says, snorting, “We’ve known for weeks.” “What? How?” Tom smirks. “Our parents are detectives. Think we’ve learned the trade by now.” “Also, I um— I found women’s pants in the dryer at dad’s house. Figured they weren’t his,” Daisy says, a crimson blush working its way across her cheeks. “Right. Well. You guys are okay with it, then?” Alec asks, wishing for a massive sinkhole to open up beneath him, right here in Ellie’s sitting room. Daisy gets up from her spot on the couch, suddenly, and kisses Alec’s cheek. “I like Ellie, dad. Always have,” she says, while moving in to give Ellie a hug. “Just maybe… be more careful about the pants. And if I hear anything, I’m moving back to Sandbrook.” Tom nods, hoisting Fred up and moving to join Daisy. “Same goes for you, Mum.” Ellie barks out a laugh, and then buries her face in Alec’s shoulder. “I think we’ve just been given a warning by our children,” she says, her voice muffled by his t-shirt. “Looks that way, doesn’t it?” He makes a show of scooting away from her, measuring out the distance between them on the couch. “Now quit leaning on me. Tom seemed rather serious,” he teases. “Wanker,” she says, playfully slapping his shoulder. It takes five months for Alec to start sleeping over with some regularity. He is not a permanent fixture in her home, but is around often enough for a lingering presence to be felt long after he leaves. A pair of his trousers hangs limply over the chair in her bedroom, an old paperback he’s been reading sits on the nightstand by his side of the bed. She buys his favourite tea at Tesco’s. It is unspeakable, this new intimacy of theirs. She finds she cannot think about it, cannot stop to consider how it is that she’s come to love and depend on this grumpy, scruffy Scot. Tonight she wakes him up with the sound of her cries. After Joe, she’d been plagued with nightmares and panic attacks, but they had dwindled when she’d started taking diazepam. This is her first in months. In it, she dreams of Danny, and of Joe. She doesn’t know what it says about her, that even in her dreams she isn’t able to save him, isn’t able to recognize the signs of paedophelia in Joe until it’s too late. But she kills him. In her dreams, she is creative. Wraps her hands around his neck, pushes him off cliffs, shoots him with a gun. She wakes to the gentle press of hands on her waist, a whispered, “It’s alright, love,” in her ear. “God, I’m sorry. I just—“ She bolts out of bed, barely making it into the bathroom before vomiting. After she finishes, she stays on the bathroom floor, hoping the cool tiles will soothe her, make her less clammy. She hears Alec pad into the bathroom, later, a towel and glass of water in hand. “Thanks,” she says, taking the proffered items. There is a lingering silence between them while she goes about cleaning herself up at the sink. She rinses her mouth out twice, and then splashes cold water on her face. All the while, he watches her, his back to the bathroom counter. Finally, he says: “We could talk about it.” Ellie lets out a long, impatient sigh. She had hoped he wouldn’t say that. Actually, she had hoped to never address it. Wasn’t there an unwritten rule about dating that says you should wait at least a year before revealing any skeletons in your closet? Not that they'd ever been rule followers. She turns to him, then, and says, “Nothing to talk about.” “Is it Joe?” “And Danny.” He frowns sympathetically at her, then busies himself making soothing circles on her back. Clearly, he is waiting for her to elaborate. “Do you remember what Susan Wright said to us? About death, and how once its got its claws in you, it doesn’t let go? I think maybe— I think she was right.” She swipes the tears off of her face before continuing. “I still have nightmares about him. Joe, I mean. I kill him every time, and in my dreams I’m so angry, I don’t know what do, Alec I’m—“ She crumples into him, then, her tears soaking into his shirt. She holds onto him until her breathing regulates, and the nausea subsides, wondering briefly when his generic soap and deodorant smell had become the only thing in the world capable of calming her down. “Come on,” he says. “Let’s get some rest.” He leads her back to bed and folds himself around her like a question mark, his arm a pleasurable weight across her midriff.  She won't sleep again tonight, but she is glad he's here. Glad he's chosen to stay. It takes a full year for them to start blending their relationship and family lives together. Daisy has only recently started to spend the night at Ellie’s when her father does. They try to make the transition as easy as possible. Ellie stresses the importance of family dinners, despite being the only person in the house incapable of putting together a single dish. It is during one of these family dinners — in the middle of some confusing debate between Tom and Daisy over the best Great British Bake Off contestant — that she realises how happy she is. The sensation is so strong, and abrupt, that she has to excuse herself from the table. She wipes at her eyes in the loo, and then takes a few calming breaths before rejoining them all at the table, smiling at Alec’s questioning gaze. Later, after they've finished their meal, he joins her in the kitchen. He grabs a towel and starts to dry and put away the dishes she's washed. "Were you alright back there? At dinner?" He asks, reaching to grab another plate from her hand.  “I never thought that I could have this again,” she says, somewhat awestruck. She is staring out the window while she washes, watching as Tom swings Fred around by the arms. Loud, high-pitched giggles emanate from their yard, Fred squealing in delight both at the motion, and at Daisy taking their picture from a safe spot across the grass. The sight of them all together, relatively happy, makes her heart so full she thinks it might burst.   Ellie knows that they’ve got a long ways to go, yet. Joe had left them all battered and bruised, a little worse for the wear. In her worst moments, she thinks she’ll never rid herself of the black cloud he had cast over their family; instead, steeling herself for years and years of unhappiness.  But now, in this kitchen with Alec, soaping up dishes while their children soak up the last of the daylight, it’s impossible to think that things won’t get better. That they won’t all, in fact, be perfectly alright. There must be thousands of people in this city who are dying to welcome you into their small bolted rooms, to sit you down and tell you what has happened to their lives.

her suffering is dead. I am her descendant.
I love the scar-tissue she handed on to me,
but I want to go on from here with you
fighting the temptation to make a career of pain.”
- Adrienne Rich, “VIII” “Do you ever regret it?” She pauses for a beat, sifts through the paper holding her fish and chips. “Taking the fall for Tess, I mean.” They are sitting on the wall above the beach, their feet swinging back and forth, drumming an off-beat rhythm against the stone. It had been his idea to come out here. On his way to work this morning he’d noticed the blue sky, had actually stopped to admire how beautiful it looked here, in Broadchurch of all places. And because he wasn’t the type of person to notice blue skies or promising days — hadn’t been that type of person ever, actually — he’d decided to make something of it. So he’d invited her to lunch. On a sticky note. She had laughed at the note when she saw it on her desk, snickered at the sight of his first and last name below a very formally written, “Miller — Lunch at half twelve?”  When she had returned the note to him she’d been beaming, treating him to one of her rare gummy smiles. She’d even taken the time to write back, in her almost child-like handwriting, “YES OR NO” and had circled the yes. She had ribbed him about it almost incessantly throughout the morning, this bumbling and awkward attempt at humanity he’d made. But she was smiling as she did it, so he endured it.  When they left the office at exactly half twelve they had both been giddy with excitement, each prattling on nervously about their children. Which is why he is startled, then, by the directness of her question. By the sheer fucking seriousness of it. Hadn’t they just been laughing about some silly thing Fred had done?  “Never. I regret missing so much of Daisy’s life, but there are things… I couldn’t give her. A girl needs her mother.” He can feel her eyes on him, now, staring at him as if expecting him to elaborate on what it is exactly he couldn’t give to Daisy. He doesn’t.  She sighs and crosses her legs, crumples up the paper that once held her fish and chips. “Children need their fathers, too, Hardy.”  He turns to face her, then. There is something in her face, and the way she had placed an emphasis on the word children, that leads him to believe they are no longer talking about him. Though he is always surprised when the conversation turns to this, he is never blindsided by it. Miller only lets herself talk about Joe indirectly, using abstract questions or by going suddenly sullen, as if a look alone is enough to convey all of her thoughts. And usually, it is.  But because he has run out of ways to tell her that it isn’t her fault, that she couldn’t possibly have known, he doesn’t say any of that. He simply wipes the hand he had used to eat his fish and chips on his trousers, and then tentatively — very tentatively — reaches out and takes her hand.  He continues to stare at her long enough to notice the twitch of her eyebrows, the beginnings of shock starting to register on her face, before he gets embarrassed and looks down. He watches his own fingers toy with hers, getting used to the softness of them. The slight greasiness from her own fish and chips. And then, as softly as he can manage, he says, “I know. I know they do.”  She invites him over for dinner that evening. Or rather, she invites him to come cook at her home, arguing that while she can cook, it’s rude to serve guests food they can’t eat. He doesn’t disagree with her.  She huffs out a laugh when she opens the door and sees him. “Oh good, you’ve changed into something more comfortable,” she deadpans. He is in the same suit he wore earlier that day.  He grins back at her and then looks down at himself, as if taking in his outfit for the first time. “I took my tie off, at least.”  She shakes her head and reaches out for him, grabbing him by the wrist and tugging him inside. She has always man-handled him this way, shoving him and pulling him along, moving him as she sees fit. It’s as if being a mum to two boys has made her impervious to normal human behaviour, has shaped her into a more tactile and pushier version of herself. It used to drive him bloody insane in the early days, but now he quite likes it. He is troubled by this.  Ellie stops them suddenly on her way into the kitchen, letting her hand move around his wrist. “Hardy, you didn’t! You took your cuff-links off too? Next thing I know, you’ll be showing up at my home in trousers,” she says, mock-scandalised.  He gives her a pained look. “Oi! Keep it up and I might just accidentally cook enough food for three,” he teases.  She smiles back at him, a teasing sort of grin that is just shy of flirty. “Enough food for one, you mean? The boys aren’t here.”  When he doesn’t immediately respond, her demeanor changes. She removes her hand from his wrist with a nervous jerk, and says, “That is okay, isn’t it? I just thought- you know, they’re always here when you come over and they’re so loud and just… everywhere. Lucy offered to take them, in fact she’s probably teaching Tom how to play online poker right now but I can-”  He cuts her off mid-ramble by placing a hand on her shoulder. “Miller, it’s okay. I bought enough food for four, though, so I hope you’re hungry,” he says.  She visibly relaxes beneath his hand, exhaling with relief. “Well, that’s good, because I’ve got enough wine for four, too,” she laughs.  ++  Things had been changing between the two of them ever since Joe, an accidental intimacy that filled in all of the empty spaces in their lives. She relied on him more, for meals and companionship and — once he had his surgery and got cleared for it — as a person to pick her kids up when she couldn’t. My boss is a real hard-arse. I can’t get away from work, she’d joked once. Can you pick Tom up from football practice?  He can’t pinpoint when, exactly, he’d started to develop feelings for her. He had always found her attractive, had always been fond of the way her hair smelled when she came into work in the morning. But she had annoyed him, too, in the beginning and so he had been able to look past it.  And now things are different. They touch each other more, seeking out hugs after unusually difficult days and, on more than one occasion, they’ve held hands.  After the Trish Winterman case he had kissed her on the cheek. Outside on the steps, she had told him that she wasn’t okay. That she was miserable and so fucking sick of it all. Sick of being a single parent, sick of being ostracised in Broadchurch, sick of having to go to work every day and face the cruelties human-beings were capable of inflicting upon one another. It was all too much. Watching as tears welled up in her eyes, he found himself wishing he had never solved Danny Latimer’s murder, had never introduced that pain into her life. He didn't know what to say to make it better, so he kissed her cheek, let his hand make soothing circles on her back.  They never talk about it. ++ “Food about ready yet? I’m starving.”  She is well into her second glass of wine at this point, leaning back against the kitchen countertop, watching him as he stirs a pasta sauce.  They had been passing the time while he cooked in much the same way they always did, exchanging anecdotes about their kids and speculating about the case of the moment. He had been pointedly ignoring the fact that there were no kids around to speak of, if only because it made him nervous. Was tonight the night they’d finally talk about their growing intimacy? Had she intended for this to be a date? It was too much to think about, so he had busied himself with chopping vegetables and focused on the soothing cadence of her voice while she filled him in on some inane Broadchurch gossip.  She was cheekier tonight, too. Had kept asking him about when the food would be ready, kept jumping at every opportunity to tease him, to laugh flirtatiously at something he said. It had turned him into a nervous, bumbling idiot. He couldn’t keep his eyes off her, had almost sliced his hand several times. And to think, dinner wasn’t even ready yet.  For now, he tries to keep his mind off of it. He sighs and turns away from his sauce, and says, “Miller, you’ve asked me that every five minutes for the last hour.”  She gives him the finger. And then, after a lingering silence, asks, “What do I have to do to get you to call me Ellie?”  The two glasses of wine on a nearly empty stomach have made her bold, lowered her inhibitions. She sets her empty glass on the counter, and moves to stand beside him. She is so close he can smell her shampoo. Close enough to kiss, he thinks, somewhat wistfully.  “I mean, I know you don’t like your first name. But I like mine. And you cook in my kitchen, pick my kids up when I can’t. Surely that puts us on a first name basis.” She pauses, as if deep in thought, and reaches out to touch his shoulder. “Don’t you think, Alec?”  He can’t breathe, can’t think. Can’t manage to do anything, actually, when she is looking at him like that. Her predatory smirk tells him she is fully aware of how flustered she’s made him.  She steps even closer to him, wedging herself between him and the sauce on the stove, leaving her hand in its place on his shoulder. With her other hand, she grabs the spoon from him and dips it into the sauce, takes her time tasting it.  “Mmm. Sauce is ready,” she says. “I’ll go set the table.”  With a final smirk, she moves to step away from him, making sure that every part of her body brushes up against his in the process.  He splashes his face with cold water and takes a couple deep breaths before he grabs the food and joins her at the table.  He isn’t going to make it. ++ They eat most of their meal in a companionable silence, both them occasionally mentioning how good the food is.  Ellie pours herself another glass of wine, and adds some more to his. He glances up at her as she does so, and before he can stop himself, says, “It does.”  She gives him a look that he has become familiar with, the one that says you’re crazy, Hardy, and asks, “What?”  “This,” he motions between the two of them, gestures at the dinner table, “is worthy of first names. You’re right. I’ll… try to make more of an effort to call you Ellie.”  She smiles at him for a minute, and then continues to eat, grinning down at her plate as she does so. “Outside of work only, of course,” he adds. “And you should still call me Hardy. Or better yet, sir, if you really felt like it,” he says, jokingly.  “Knob,” she says, and swats at him playfully. ++ By the time they have finished dinner, and she has chided him for not bringing a proper dessert, they are both tipsy. Drunk, actually.  Without Tom or Fred present to keep them in line, the wine had flowed freely, and the topics of conversation had entered new territory. They had mustered only enough energy to move the dishes into the kitchen, and then decided to take up residence on her couch.  They are in the middle of laughing hysterically about the time Dirty Brian had asked her out while she was still married, when she suddenly grows serious, and says, “You know, I asked him out again. After Joe. And he turned me down, said he was seeing somebody at the moment. But sometimes I wonder if maybe it was because of me, like the knowledge of what Joe… did has tainted me somehow, to everyone. Like I’m damaged goods or something,” she says, laughing nervously.  He hates that this is happening to her, hates that every day there is a new issue, a new obstacle for her to confront because of Joe.  “You aren’t damaged goods, Mill- Ellie,” he says. She turns to face him, smiling sadly,  “Ellie, huh? You must be serious.”  “I am being serious. You’ve gone through something awful, and it’s going to take a while to heal. It doesn’t happen over night. But as far men go… any man would be… lucky to have you,” he says.  She scoffs and takes a long sip of her wine, setting it down on the table and then turning back to face him. “Yeah, right.”  “Miller, don’t-”  “Hardy, I’ve been trying to get you to shag me for months,” she slurs, “and you haven’t noticed. Or, worse, you have and you’re so put-off by the idea that you’re pretending you haven’t noticed.”  He freezes, unsure of how to proceed next. Had she just drunkenly confessed to wanting to fuck him? He was attracted to her, had sort-of thought she might be attracted to him. And they had grown so close after Joe’s arrest. But he had never let himself imagine things could go in this direction.  Ellie was gaining her life back in increments. Beth was starting to come around more often, her relationship with her boys was improving every day. She had been leaning on him – they had been leaning on each other – so much, but he had always assumed it wasn’t permanent. Ellie, with her bright orange windbreaker and infectious smile, burned so much brighter than he did, even on his best days. He had always assumed that moving on from him, not needing him anymore, would just be another step towards growth. Like the time she invited him over to help paint her bedroom a new color and rearrange the furniture.  The idea that she might want him around for good had surprised him, properly sobered him up. And although he’s scared, and nervous, he finds that she’s just vocalised something that he wants. He suddenly cannot imagine anything he wants more.  “I’m not,” he says. “Put off by the idea, that is. I just… didn’t think you saw me that way. Or that you were ready for it- um, me, I mean.”  She looks at him for a second, and then tilts her head back and laughs, a bright and happy sound.  “Christ, Hardy, you are the biggest idiot I’ve ever met,” she says, reaching out to cup his face in her hands.  She leans in a bit, waiting for him to meet her in the middle.  Their first kiss is just a soft pressing of mouths together, nothing too daring. Her lips are soft, and she tastes faintly of whatever Malbec it is that she had been serving him throughout the night.  When they break apart, she blushes and smiles shyly at him. It was a sweet, simple kiss, and entirely not enough for him.  He moves to tangle his hand in her hair, and bends down to kiss her again, this time opening his mouth to let her tongue in. After a couple minutes of proper snogging, she pushes against his shoulders and moves to climb on top of him, straddling him on her couch. She pulls away from him for a second, her lips swollen and cheeks pink. “Is this okay?” she asks, breathlessly.  He shakes with laughter, letting his hand drift up and down her back. “God, it’s so much better than okay.”  Ellie grabs a hold of his hands and places them on her waist, and returns to the task at hand. For a while the only sounds in her house are the soft sighs and moans they make, the rustling of the couch beneath their combined weight. When his mouth drops down to place open-mouthed kisses on her throat, stopping to suck briefly at her pulse point, she grinds herself into his groin with a loud moan. It feels so good he kicks his leg out, knocking over her wine glass in the process.  “Shit,” she says, when she hears the shattering of glass. They break apart and she uses the arm of the sofa to leverage herself off of his lap, trying to assess the damage with what little brain power she has left.  He gets up, too, rushing into the kitchen to grab a broom and some towels to wipe up the mess.  When he comes back in, she is running her hands through hair, trying to straighten her clothes and make herself appear less rumpled. Less like she’d just been drunkenly making-out with her boss on her couch.  She sees him, finally, and her eyes zero in on his lap, where further evidence of their previous activity is… prominent. She smirks at him, and then says, “I’ll get the mess. You should… take a minute.”  He feels himself turn red, and moves to hand her the broom and towels. “Right, um. Yeah. Okay.”  He heads to the loo, splashes cold water on his hands and face. What the fuck was that, he thinks. When she had invited him over for dinner tonight he had never expected it to go like this, had never pictured Ellie straddling him on a couch for the better part of an hour. God, he was in trouble. And hopelessly turned on.  When he walks back into the room, she has the mess mostly contained, though she continues to sweep nervously.  “Should we-”  “Do you think-”  They both start talking at the same time, and then stop and laugh. She sighs and says, “You go first.”  “I just- we should talk about this right?”  Ellie smiles weakly at him and then says, “That’s what I was thinking.”  He is suddenly nervous. What if she didn’t like it? Or worse, what if she’s trying to find a way to tell him she never wants to see him again? He takes a deep breath and releases it, a bit shakily. “Ellie, I don’t know what your feelings are on… us. I don’t even know if it would be smart for us to do this right now, with everything that’s going on in our lives and with our jobs. But I do know that spending time with you, with your boys and Daisy, has made me the happiest I’ve been in… a long time. Ever, probably.”  He directs his eyes towards the carpet, growing shy and embarrassed over the emotional direction this is taking.  “I want to be with you, in any capacity that you’ll have me. Whether that’s just as some bloke that helps you cook and picks up your kids, or as something… more. That has to be up to you.”  When he looks up from the carpet at her, there are tears in her eyes. She moves to close the space between them, wrapping her arms around his neck and says, “More. I want something more,” and then adds, cheekily, “Sir.”  “Oi!” he says, and lifts his hand from its spot on her waist to lightly swat her arse.  They both dissolve into a fit of giggles, ending only when Ellie rests her head against his chest.  “When do you have to pick the boys up from Lucy’s?” he asks, suddenly.  “About half ten tomorrow morning. Why?”  “Well,” he says, moving to check his watch, “by my count, that means you have… about ten hours to kill. Any plans?”  She gives him her famous gummy smile when she catches onto his line of thinking, and then says, “Well now that you mention it, there’s something I’d like to have you take a look at. Upstairs.”  He grabs onto her hand when she turns away from him, starting on her trek upstairs. “Why don’t you lead the way?”  She tugs a bit on his hand, turning back to flash him another smile.  “Always.” “Well, that’s finished. The woman who cherished
her suffering is dead. I am her descendant.
I love the scar-tissue she handed on to me,
but I want to go on from here with you
fighting the temptation to make a career of pain.”
- Adrienne Rich, “VIII” “Do you ever regret it?” She pauses for a beat, sifts through the paper holding her fish and chips. “Taking the fall for Tess, I mean.” They are sitting on the wall above the beach, their feet swinging back and forth, drumming an off-beat rhythm against the stone. It had been his idea to come out here. On his way to work this morning he’d noticed the blue sky, had actually stopped to admire how beautiful it looked here, in Broadchurch of all places. And because he wasn’t the type of person to notice blue skies or promising days — hadn’t been that type of person ever, actually — he’d decided to make something of it. So he’d invited her to lunch. On a sticky note. She had laughed at the note when she saw it on her desk, snickered at the sight of his first and last name below a very formally written, “Miller — Lunch at half twelve?”  When she had returned the note to him she’d been beaming, treating him to one of her rare gummy smiles. She’d even taken the time to write back, in her almost child-like handwriting, “YES OR NO” and had circled the yes. She had ribbed him about it almost incessantly throughout the morning, this bumbling and awkward attempt at humanity he’d made. But she was smiling as she did it, so he endured it.  When they left the office at exactly half twelve they had both been giddy with excitement, each prattling on nervously about their children. Which is why he is startled, then, by the directness of her question. By the sheer fucking seriousness of it. Hadn’t they just been laughing about some silly thing Fred had done?  “Never. I regret missing so much of Daisy’s life, but there are things… I couldn’t give her. A girl needs her mother.” He can feel her eyes on him, now, staring at him as if expecting him to elaborate on what it is exactly he couldn’t give to Daisy. He doesn’t.  She sighs and crosses her legs, crumples up the paper that once held her fish and chips. “Children need their fathers, too, Hardy.”  He turns to face her, then. There is something in her face, and the way she had placed an emphasis on the word children, that leads him to believe they are no longer talking about him. Though he is always surprised when the conversation turns to this, he is never blindsided by it. Miller only lets herself talk about Joe indirectly, using abstract questions or by going suddenly sullen, as if a look alone is enough to convey all of her thoughts. And usually, it is.  But because he has run out of ways to tell her that it isn’t her fault, that she couldn’t possibly have known, he doesn’t say any of that. He simply wipes the hand he had used to eat his fish and chips on his trousers, and then tentatively — very tentatively — reaches out and takes her hand.  He continues to stare at her long enough to notice the twitch of her eyebrows, the beginnings of shock starting to register on her face, before he gets embarrassed and looks down. He watches his own fingers toy with hers, getting used to the softness of them. The slight greasiness from her own fish and chips. And then, as softly as he can manage, he says, “I know. I know they do.”  She invites him over for dinner that evening. Or rather, she invites him to come cook at her home, arguing that while she can cook, it’s rude to serve guests food they can’t eat. He doesn’t disagree with her.  She huffs out a laugh when she opens the door and sees him. “Oh good, you’ve changed into something more comfortable,” she deadpans. He is in the same suit he wore earlier that day.  He grins back at her and then looks down at himself, as if taking in his outfit for the first time. “I took my tie off, at least.”  She shakes her head and reaches out for him, grabbing him by the wrist and tugging him inside. She has always man-handled him this way, shoving him and pulling him along, moving him as she sees fit. It’s as if being a mum to two boys has made her impervious to normal human behaviour, has shaped her into a more tactile and pushier version of herself. It used to drive him bloody insane in the early days, but now he quite likes it. He is troubled by this.  Ellie stops them suddenly on her way into the kitchen, letting her hand move around his wrist. “Hardy, you didn’t! You took your cuff-links off too? Next thing I know, you’ll be showing up at my home in trousers,” she says, mock-scandalised.  He gives her a pained look. “Oi! Keep it up and I might just accidentally cook enough food for three,” he teases.  She smiles back at him, a teasing sort of grin that is just shy of flirty. “Enough food for one, you mean? The boys aren’t here.”  When he doesn’t immediately respond, her demeanor changes. She removes her hand from his wrist with a nervous jerk, and says, “That is okay, isn’t it? I just thought- you know, they’re always here when you come over and they’re so loud and just… everywhere. Lucy offered to take them, in fact she’s probably teaching Tom how to play online poker right now but I can-”  He cuts her off mid-ramble by placing a hand on her shoulder. “Miller, it’s okay. I bought enough food for four, though, so I hope you’re hungry,” he says.  She visibly relaxes beneath his hand, exhaling with relief. “Well, that’s good, because I’ve got enough wine for four, too,” she laughs.  ++  Things had been changing between the two of them ever since Joe, an accidental intimacy that filled in all of the empty spaces in their lives. She relied on him more, for meals and companionship and — once he had his surgery and got cleared for it — as a person to pick her kids up when she couldn’t. My boss is a real hard-arse. I can’t get away from work, she’d joked once. Can you pick Tom up from football practice?  He can’t pinpoint when, exactly, he’d started to develop feelings for her. He had always found her attractive, had always been fond of the way her hair smelled when she came into work in the morning. But she had annoyed him, too, in the beginning and so he had been able to look past it.  And now things are different. They touch each other more, seeking out hugs after unusually difficult days and, on more than one occasion, they’ve held hands.  After the Trish Winterman case he had kissed her on the cheek. Outside on the steps, she had told him that she wasn’t okay. That she was miserable and so fucking sick of it all. Sick of being a single parent, sick of being ostracised in Broadchurch, sick of having to go to work every day and face the cruelties human-beings were capable of inflicting upon one another. It was all too much. Watching as tears welled up in her eyes, he found himself wishing he had never solved Danny Latimer’s murder, had never introduced that pain into her life. He didn't know what to say to make it better, so he kissed her cheek, let his hand make soothing circles on her back.  They never talk about it. ++ “Food about ready yet? I’m starving.”  She is well into her second glass of wine at this point, leaning back against the kitchen countertop, watching him as he stirs a pasta sauce.  They had been passing the time while he cooked in much the same way they always did, exchanging anecdotes about their kids and speculating about the case of the moment.

Surely that puts us on a first name basis.” She pauses, as if deep in thought, and reaches out to touch his shoulder. “Don’t you think, Alec?”  He can’t breathe, can’t think. Can’t manage to do anything, actually, when she is looking at him like that. Her predatory smirk tells him she is fully aware of how flustered she’s made him.  She steps even closer to him, wedging herself between him and the sauce on the stove, leaving her hand in its place on his shoulder. With her other hand, she grabs the spoon from him and dips it into the sauce, takes her time tasting it.  “Mmm.

He splashes his face with cold water and takes a couple deep breaths before he grabs the food and joins her at the table.  He isn’t going to make it. ++ They eat most of their meal in a companionable silence, both them occasionally mentioning how good the food is.
